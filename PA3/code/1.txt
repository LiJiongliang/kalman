No, the EM algorithm is only guaranteed to converge to a local maximum, so even if we had a third initial state that had a better log-likelihood in the first iteration, the EM algorithm might still converge to a log-likelihood that is lower than the final log-likelihood that is reached using InitialClassProb1.
