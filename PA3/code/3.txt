Clustering algorithms can be applied to determine the number of class labels. Specifically, a k-means approach could be used. You can pick 'k' from a distribution, run k-means and use EM to assign each sample from the dataset to a cluster. Once k-means converges you can measure the average intracluster similarity and then pick a new 'k' in many ways (simulating anealing, conjugate gradient, etc.) Once average intracluster similarity has converged, you know the number of clusters and the number of class labels.
